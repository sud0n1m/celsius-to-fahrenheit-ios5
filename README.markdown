## Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter for iOS ##

Hello world, this is my first iOS application. Nothing too exciting here, I just connected the UI to a simple function that converts numerical input from the user (presumed to be a temperature in celsius) to fahrenheit.

I built it in Xcode 4.2 for iOS5 and it almost definitely won't work on earlier versions of Xcode but probably will work on iOS4.
